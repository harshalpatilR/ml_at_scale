# Machine Learning at Scale
Flight analytics and cancellation prediction with sparklyr and pyspark

This project is for the end-to-end ML at Scale workshop. It creates an API that can predict the likelihood of a flight being cancelled based on historic flight data. The original dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yuanyuwendymu/airline-delay-and-cancellation-data-2009-2018). The workshop shows both the pyspark and sparklyr implementations and covers:

+ Data Science and Exploration
+ ML Model Building
+ ML Model Optimisation
+ ML Model Training
+ ML Model Serving
